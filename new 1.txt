=== CONSENT-BASED PHONE PRANK ===
From: [Your Name]

To activate this 3-message prank:

1. Open Chrome on your phone
2. Copy and paste this into the address bar:
   javascript:for(let i=1;i<=3;i++){setTimeout(()=>{alert("Message "+i+" of 3 from [Your Name]!")},i*1000);}

3. Tap 'Go'
4. You'll get 3 alert messages, 1 second apart!

Note: This only works because you consented! 😊
